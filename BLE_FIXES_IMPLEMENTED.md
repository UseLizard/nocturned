# BLE Fixes Implemented

## Summary
Implemented key fixes from BLE_COMPREHENSIVE_FIX_PLAN.md to improve BLE connection stability and performance.

## 1. Command Queue with ACK Handling (Partial)
**Status**: Structure implemented, ACK waiting TODO

### What was done:
- Added `CommandQueueItem` struct with command ID tracking
- Added `CommandAck` struct for acknowledgment handling
- Implemented command queue channel (buffered, 100 commands)
- Added `processCommandQueue()` goroutine for serial command processing
- Modified `SendCommand()` to queue commands instead of direct sending
- Added ACK handling in `handleNotificationData()` for "ack" messages
- Added command ID generation for tracking

### Still TODO:
- Implement proper ACK waiting mechanism with channels
- Add timeout handling for commands without ACK
- Add command retry on ACK failure

## 2. State Polling for Faster Updates
**Status**: Fully implemented

### What was done:
- Added `startStatePolling()` method with 500ms ticker
- Added `pollCharacteristicValue()` to read characteristic directly
- Added `lastPolledValue` tracking to avoid duplicate processing
- Polling starts automatically on connection
- Properly stops on disconnect

## 3. Capabilities-Based Ready State
**Status**: Fully implemented

### What was done:
- Added `fullyConnected` and `capsReceived` fields to BleClient
- Updated capabilities handler to set these flags
- Broadcasts "media/ready" event when capabilities received
- Resets flags on disconnect

## 4. Removed SPP Logic
**Status**: Fully implemented

### What was done:
- Removed `monitorNetworkInterfaces()` function and call
- Removed netlink and syscall imports (bnep0 monitoring)
- Removed SPP profile from ProfileManager defaults
- media_client.go already removed (confirmed)

## 5. Enhanced Logging
**Status**: Partially implemented

### What was done:
- Added extensive BLE_LOG prefixed logging throughout
- Command queue operations logged
- ACK handling logged
- Polling operations logged

### Still TODO:
- Enable debug log characteristic subscription
- Parse and display debug logs from Android app

## Code Quality
- All changes compile successfully
- No build errors
- Backward compatible with existing API

## Testing Required
1. Test command queue prevents ATT errors
2. Verify state polling reduces update delays
3. Confirm capabilities trigger ready state
4. Ensure no SPP conflicts remain

## Next Steps
1. Implement proper ACK waiting with channels
2. Add command timeout and retry logic
3. Enable debug log streaming
4. Test with real device
